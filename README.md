## 👋 Hi there

I build scalable, production-grade web applications used by real users in complex, high-traffic environments.

Over the past 5+ years, I’ve worked across backend and frontend systems, focusing on clean architecture, performance optimization, and long-term maintainability. Most of my work revolves around **Ruby on Rails, Django, React, and PostgreSQL**.

I enjoy solving real product problems, improving system reliability, and contributing to strong engineering practices within teams.
